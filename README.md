Mod to get 2 channel BCWAV playback in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked.


Devil Survivor Overclocked for the 3DS unfortunately not only has pretty awful audio compression (22050hz and shortened length? really??), but it's in mono as well.
Unfortunately, the game doesn't have any support for 2 channel audio at all. If you feed it a 2 channel file, channel 1 (left channel) will be played back through both speakers while channel 2 (right channel) is dropped.
The goal of this mod is to fix that by, first, providing 2 channel files to begin with, allowing 2 channel audio to be played back seamlessly, and copying 1-channel sources to both channels. This way the game's aural presentation is up to par with Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker, or hell, even the original release of Devil Survivor on DS.


Currently do not know how to accomplish this. A new code.bin file would be ideal, but a cheat code works too if that's easier.
